The simple truth is - not everybody has a privilege of even considering to attend the amazing @MIT and @Oxford.

Most of us, especially those from underprivileged groups, simply do not have money to study there.
 
*Together* we are going to change it.
We aim to give everybody a chance to progress in the luxurious world of IT, 
through contributions to #OpenSource project. The projects must (and will) be aligned with individual’s values.
 
Together we Opensource.
