# Together We Open Source

## Background

The simple truth is - not everybody has a privilege of even considering to attend the amazing MIT or Oxford.

Most of us, especially those from underprivileged groups, simply do not have money to study there.
 
*Together*, **_we_** are going to change it.

We aim to give everybody a chance to progress in the luxurious world of IT, through contributions to [#OpenSource](https://github.com/topics/opensource) projects. The projects must (and will) be aligned with an individualâ€™s values.
 
_Together we Open Source._
